/**
 * Helps output conditional helper methods.
 *
 * The `ConditionalOutput` concept is split into a usage site and a declaration
 * site, i.e. declaring a `function someHelper() { ... }`, and calling it
 * like `someHelper()`.
 *
 * While generating code, you can make usage says by using `someHelper` as
 * a placeholder, and then output the declaration with `someHelper.ifUsed`
 * to output the declaration conditionally only if `someHelper` has been
 * seen in the tree.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const someHelper = conditionalOutput(
 *   "someHelper",
 *   code`function someHelper() { return 1 } `
 * );
 *
 * const code = code`
 *   ${someHelper}
 *
 *   ${someHelper.ifUsed}
 * `
 * ```
