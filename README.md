# Download workflow artifact GitHub Action

An action that downloads and extracts uploaded artifacts associated with a given workflow and commit or other criteria.

Let's suppose you have a workflow with a job in it that at the end uploads an artifact using `actions/upload-artifact` action and you want to download this artifact in another workflow that is run after the first one. Official `actions/download-artifact` does not allow this. That's why I decided to create this action. By knowing only the workflow name and commit SHA or other details, you can download the previously uploaded artifact from different workflow associated with that commit or other criteria and use it.

## Usage

> If `commit` or `pr` or `branch` or `run_id` or `workflow_conclusion` is not specified then the artifact from the most recent successfully completed workflow run will be downloaded.

**Do not specify `pr`, `commit`, `branch`, `run_id` together or `workflow_conclusion` and `run_id` together. Pick just one of each or none.**

    workflow_conclusion: success
    # Optional, will get head commit SHA
